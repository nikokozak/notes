# Notes App Development Log

## QuillJS Rich Text Editor Integration

### Initial Setup
1. Created QuillComponent LiveView component
2. Added Quill npm package to assets:
    cd assets
    npm install quill

### Component Structure
- Created lib/notes_web/components/quill_component.ex
- Implemented basic LiveComponent with toolbar and editor areas
- Added phx-hook="QuillEditor" for JavaScript integration
- Critical fix: Added phx-update="ignore" to both toolbar and editor to prevent LiveView DOM conflicts

### JavaScript Integration
- Added QuillEditor hook in assets/js/app.js
- Configured Quill with snow theme and custom toolbar
- Implemented text-change event handler to sync with server
- Added initialization check to prevent multiple Quill instances

### CSS Implementation
- Added Quill CSS imports to assets/css/app.css:
  - quill.core.css
  - quill.snow.css
- Created custom styling for editor wrapper and toolbar
- Positioned Quill imports before Tailwind utilities to maintain proper cascade

### Key Learnings
1. LiveView and Quill DOM handling can conflict - use phx-update="ignore"
2. Toolbar must be properly structured for Quill to recognize it
3. CSS order matters for proper styling
4. Hook cleanup is important to prevent memory leaks

### Current Features
- Rich text editing with standard toolbar options
- Real-time content syncing with server
- Custom styled interface
- Proper integration with LiveView updates

### Usage Example
    elixir <.live_component module={QuillComponent} id="note-editor" content={@content} />

### Future Considerations
- Add image upload handling
- Implement content versioning
- Add collaborative editing features
- Consider adding custom toolbar configurations
